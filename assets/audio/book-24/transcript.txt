0001: It is sixteen years since John Berkston died.
0002: His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks the graves
  gleams across the wheat fields.
0003: A brisk wind had come up and was now driving puffy white clouds across
  the sky

  the gilded weatherwaves on the big red barns wink at each other across the
  green and brown and yellow fields.
